BREAST CANCER PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING (SVM MODEL)

Data set is provided as cancer.csv file.

Complete implementation was provided in BREAST_CANCER_PREDICTION_USING_SVM.ipynb.

When it comes to breast cancer prediction SVM model gives the finest of prediction.

This is a supervised learning approach where the provided data set acts as training and test data in 80:20 ratio.

Confusion matrix obtained is with high accuracy or with minimal errors.

Accuracy obtained by the created SVM model is around 97%.
